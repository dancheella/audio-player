A project has been developed that represents an audio player with a user interface. Functional control elements have
been created, including Play/Pause buttons and track navigation "Forward" and "Backward." Users can easily control
playback, and the cover art and track information update when switching tracks. The progress bar accurately displays the
current time and track duration, making the listening process more convenient. There is a song list that users can
browse and select tracks to play, as well as volume control to allow users to adjust the sound to their liking.
